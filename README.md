Using Spotify's APIs to: <br />
- Read user's top 5 songs from the past 4 weeks
- Generate an average based on the numberical values of the audio features of each song
- Compare the user's average to each Taylor Ablum average I generated in my preliminary analysis  
- The album average the user is closest to is their Taylor Era!
<br />
